								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>A</strong>raby is a short story by modernist writer James Joyce (1882 to 1941) which was published in 1914. As with many stories by Joyce and other modernist writers, &#8216;Araby&#8217; employs a close first-person narrator describing the world as it appeals to his senses, and leaves the reader with only a suggested, rather than outright, moral resolution. James Joyce&#8217;s “Araby” is a short story centering on an Irish adolescent emerging from boyhood fantasies into the harsh realities of everyday life in his country. The story “Araby” conveys the idea that the personal feelings of a person and the real world are two different things. The writer has described the intensity of the schoolboy’s love at various places in the story. Boy of about twelve who becomes infatuated with the sister of his friend, Mangan. He has friends, keeps active, and nurtures a dream: to win the attentions of the Mangan girl. Although she hardly notices him and converses with him only a few casual words, she is constantly in his thoughts even though they had never had a conversation. Finally, a day comes when she speaks to him andout of his childness and lack of knowledge about reality he tells her that if he goes to the bazaar called Araby, he will bring back something for her. After that day he can think of nothing but her and of the gift he will buy her at the bazaar. The protagonist has a series of romantic ideas, about the girl and the wondrous event that he will attend on her behalf. For him, she is an exotic, lovely creature, foreign to Dublin. And the bazaar—Araby, as it is called—represents a distant, mystical land to which he will travel on behalf of his beloved to obtain for her a splendid keepsake. Here Joyce provides the protagonist with a specific, dramatic conflict that is the need to impress Mangan&#8217;s sister with a gift from Araby. Though apparently minor, this desire is compelling because it is so intensely felt by him. Then the writer puts roadblocks in the way of the boy and the reader: the wait for Saturday itself, and then for the uncle&#8217;s return from work. After a long wait begins the agonizingly slow journey itself, which seems to take place in slow motion, like a nightmare. When he finally does arrive, the bazaar is more or less over. The boy has arrived too late to do any serious shopping, but quickly we see that his tardiness does not matter. Any nice gift is well beyond the protagonist&#8217;s price range. In this moment, he suddenly awakens to the bleakness of the humdrum life around him. We know, from the description of the boy&#8217;s housing situation and the small sum his uncle gives him, that their financial situation is tight. Though his anticipation of the event has provided him with pleasant daydreams, reality is much harsher. He remains a prisoner of his modest means and his city. His fantasies about the bazaar and buying a great gift for the girl are revealed as ridiculous. For one thing, the bazaar is a rather tawdry shadow of the boy&#8217;s dreams. He overhears the conversation of some of the vendors, who are ordinary English women, and the mundane nature of the talk drives home that there is no escape: bazaar or not, the boy is still in Dublin, and the accents of the vendors remind the reader that Dublin is a colonized city. Like the bazaar that offers experiences that differ from everyday Dublin, Mangan’s sister intoxicates the narrator with new feelings of joy and elation. Though he promises Mangan’s sister that he will go to Araby and purchase a gift for her, these mundane realities undermine his plans and ultimately thwart his desires. The narrator arrives at the bazaar only to encounter flowered teacups and English accents, not the freedom of the enchanting East. As the bazaar closes down, he realizes that his relationship with Mangan’s sister will also remain just a wishful idea and that his infatuation was as misguided as his fantasies about the bazaar. And he also realizes that it was his “vanity” when he promised to bring something for her. It is the sense of reality that makes his “eyes burn with anguish and anger”. ***The theme of the story “Araby” is that the subjective feelings of a person and the objective world are two opposing things. There is no agreement between them. When we read the story “Araby” carefully, we find that two opposing ideas have been presented. The first idea is schoolboy’s subjective feelings and the second idea is his objective or real world. There is a conflict between the personal feelings of a person and the real world. The boy falls in love with his friend’s sister. To him his subjective feeling of love is the only reality. All the other things have no importance for him. To him the serious work of live is a child’s play. He keeps on thinking about her all the time. Even when he goes to market, he thinks about her. In the classroom, he cannot pay attention to his studies. Nothing is important for him now. He usually weeps without knowing why he is weeping. He promises to buy a gift for the girl. These are the subjective feelings of the boy. This is his illusion. His objective world is that he is just a schoolboy. Perhaps he is an orphan too. His uncle is his patron. He should not have promised the girls to bring something for her. He cannot buy anything for her because he himself is dependent on his uncle. Therefore, we see that there is a big disagreement between his subjective feelings and objective world. It is only at the end of the story that he comes to know what he is and what he should not have done. He is disillusioned. With his little money, he cannot buy anything for her. It was his vanity when he promised to bring something for her. It is the sense of reality that makes his eyes burn with anguish and anger. ***Some critics have suggested that Mangan&#8217;s sister represents Ireland itself, and that therefore the boy&#8217;s quest is made on behalf of his native country. Certainly, the bazaar seems to combine elements of the Catholic Church and England. As the church has hypnotized its adherents, Araby has &#8220;cast an Eastern enchantment&#8221; over the boy. Moreover, it is &#8220;not some Freemason [Protestant] affair.&#8221; Church parishes often organized bazaars to raise money for charity. When the boy reaches the object of his quest, however, Araby (the church) is empty — except for a woman and two men who speak with English accents. The woman speaks to the story&#8217;s main character in a manner that is &#8220;not encouraging&#8221; and is clearly doing so &#8220;out of a sense of duty.&#8221; Thus, a mission on behalf of an idealized homeland (the boy does not actually know Mangan&#8217;s sister — she is more or less a fantasy to him) is thwarted in turn by the Irish themselves (the charming uncle and his propensity to drink), the church, and England.<br></p>

<p>River is written by Attipate Krishnaswami Ramanujan who is known as one of the greatest modern poet of India. The tone of the poem is based on sarcasm and irony. The structure of the poem has been in paragraphs and single lines. There are four longer verse paragraphs and a shorter one in the beginning. There are only two single isolated lines. This kind of structural arrangement contributes to the effect of irony. It also helps to grasp the main points clearly.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“A River” is a realistic description of the river Vaikai which flows through the city of Madurai. The poem implicitly comments wryly on the lack of realism with which other poets have treated the same topic. The poet has compared and contrasted the attitudes of the old poets and those of the new poets to human suffering. He has come to the conclusion that both the groups of the poets are not sympathetic, rather indifferent to human sorrow and suffering. This kind of attitude makes their poetry weak and unappealing, dry and cheerless. In the first stanza, Madurai is described as a “city of temples and poets,” making it sound like a place of great spiritual significance and associating it also with creativity and beauty. Its poets, indeed, have often sung of “cities and temples”, thereby celebrating places of great importance. Yet no sooner does the speaker make Madurai sound like a mythic, magnificent location than he immediately complicates this impression. He reports that each summer the city’s river—a river that might itself symbolize power, vitality, and energy—“dries to a trickle” uncovering “sand ribs”. He details the underbelly of the river that stays hidden. Visible now, are the bits of “straw and women’s hair” that chokes the rusty gates of the dam and the bridges that are plastered over with ‘patches of repair’. This stanza closes with a complain that all the poets ‘‘only sang of the floods’’. In stanza two, the poet speaks of the river in flood in the rains. He was there once and saw what happened. The river in spate destroys everything in its wake from live-stock to houses to human life. This happens once a year and has been continuing for years in the same pattern. He notes the casual approach of the of the towns people. Anxiously they talk of the rising level of water and enumerate mechanically the ‘precise’ number of steps as the water brims over the bathing places. The flood water “carried off three village houses,/ one pregnant woman/ and a couple of cows/ named Gopi and Brinda.” Humor is presented in the names of the cows and this too, is an attack on the orthodoxy of Hinduism. While cows are given names, no one knows who the pregnant woman is nor are they concerned. The third stanza opens with a complain that new poets have no wit but to blindly copy their predecessors and “no one spoke/ in verse/ of the pregnant woman”. The poet imagines that she may have drowned with not one life in her but two—“twins in her” which kicked “at blank walls even before birth”. He is sarcastic about both the new poets and old poets who seize only the floods to write about and that too merely once a year but did not refer to all these miseries of the woman in their poetic creations. The final stanza the poet mentions that “the river has water enough/ to be poetic” but only “once a year”. Maybe the river is beautiful and charming but it takes a heavy toll on human lives. It only takes “half-hour” to destroy “three village houses”, and take away the lives of humans and animals. This is an unusual poem with many layers of meaning and is a commentary on the indifference of the old and modern poets to the ravages caused by the river in flood and the pain and suffering caused to humans.<br></p>

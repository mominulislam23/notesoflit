<h5>“The Black Cat” is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) which was published in 1843.More than any of Poe&#8217;s stories, &#8220;The Black Cat&#8221; illustrates best the capacity of the human mind to observe its own deterioration and the ability of the mind to comment upon its own destruction without being able to objectively halt that deterioration. It is a study of the psychology of guilt, in the story a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt.</h5>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Poe believed that a man was capable at any time of undergoing a complete and total reversal of personality and of falling into a state of madness at any moment. The story opens in the cell of a prisoner the day before he is to be executed by hanging where he was writing down the details of this experience, which led to his imprisonment and scheduled execution. The narrator describes himself as a caring and loving man, who and whose wife was very fond of animals. Over the years, the narrator’s disposition changed. He became prey to certain wicked human emotions as &#8220;Intemperance&#8221; and &#8220;Perverseness,&#8221; and these feelings of excess and cruelty began to consume him. The narrator then began to drink alcohol heavily and stay out during the nighttime, staggering home very late. He became “more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others&#8221;, started shouting at his wife, and even struck her at times. He mistreated all of his pets except his most loving cat Pluto. In time, however, he even started to mistreat the cat. And one night, so enraged did the narrator become that he withdrew a pocket knife and cut out one of the cat’s eyes. The next morning, though he was horrified by what he had done the spirit of “perverseness” overcame him again with the course of time &#8211; this time, with an unfathomable longing of the soul to &#8220;offer violence . . . to do wrong for the wrong&#8217;s sake only.&#8221; Suddenly one morning, he hanged the cat from the limb of a tree, but even while doing it, tears streamed down his face. He is ashamed of his perversity because he knows that the cat had loved him and had given him no reason to hang it. What he did was an act of pure perversity. Though he was becoming mad day by day, he tried to explain everything with logic. That night, after the cruel deed was executed, his house burned to the ground. Being a rational and analytical person, the narrator refuses to see a connection between his perverse atrocity of killing the cat and the disaster that consumed his house. Peculiarly, on the single wall that did not fall in the fire is an image of a gigantic cat with a rope around its neck. The narrator explains the phenomenon away with scientific reasons. The battle in the narrator’s mind between delusion and reality rages at this point. He tries desperately to explain what he sees with rational thought, but his mind is already infected with superstition and his explanations begin to sound far-fetched and somewhat insane. In the story we see his guilt make him belief in the reincarnation of the cat. After some months he found another cat which looking exactly the same to Pluto and this one also became a great favorite to him and his wife. The narrator&#8217;s perversity, however, caused him to soon change, and the cat&#8217;s fondness for them began to disgust him. It was at this time that he began to loathe the cat. What increased his loathing of the new cat was that it had, like Pluto, one of its eyes missing. In the mind of the narrator, this cat was obviously a reincarnation of Pluto. After a time, the narrator develops an absolute dread of the cat. When he discovers the white splash on its breast, which at first was rather indefinite he was terrified. Here we can assume that the change occurs within the mind of the mad man in the same way that he considers this beast to be a reincarnation of the original Pluto. He was so much terrified that he just wanted to get rid of the cat at any cost. One day, in a fit of rage, the narrator raised an axe to strike at the creature, but he “buried the axe in” his wife’s head. The narrator realizes that he must get rid of the body and finally &#8220;wall it up in the cellar”. Afterward, he looked for the cat, “for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.” But it had disappeared–apparently in fear of his wrath. That night, even with the weight of murder on his mind, he slept soundly. After all, there was no cat to irritate him. After three days, the narrator decided that the &#8220;monster of a cat&#8221; had disappeared forever; he was now able to sleep soundly in spite of the foul deed that he had done. The narrator says, “My happiness was supreme”. This lack of guilt is certainly a change from what his feelings were at the beginning of the story. His over confidence caused his final downfall. On the fourth day, a party of police unexpectedly arrives to inspect the premises. The narrator delights in the fact that he has so cleverly and so completely concealed his horrible crime that he welcomes an inspection of the premises. When the police was about to leave, the narrator – pleased at his cleverness and his ability to handle the police – began to talk too much. In an act of insane bravado, he raps so heavily upon the bricks that entombed his wife, that to his abject terror, a &#8220;voice from within the tomb&#8221; answered. At first, it was a muffled and broken cry, but then it swelled into an &#8220;utterly anomalous and inhuman . . . might have arisen only out of hell&#8221; The police immediately began to tear down the brick wall, and they discover the rotting corpse of the narrator&#8217;s wife and, standing upon her decayed head was the &#8220;hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder . . . I had walled the monster up within the tomb.&#8221; The final irony, of course, is that the cat which he had come to so despise — the cat that might have been the reincarnation of Pluto — serves as a figure of retribution against the murderer. ************************************************************************************* **Short story in the horror genre that focuses on the psyche of the narrator. Poe was one of the developers of the short story as a literary genre. He defined a short story as a narrative prose work that (1) is short enough to be read in one sitting, (2) takes place in one locale on a single day, (or even in a few hours), (3) centers on a single line of action, and (4) maintains a single mood. Every word or phrase should contribute to the theme and the mood. *** The supernatural elements of &#8220;The Black Cat&#8221; leave open the question of how much is real, how much can be rationally explained, and how much is a product of the narrator&#8217;s imagination. Pluto&#8217;s possible magical significance is first noted by the wife, who states that black cats are said to be witches in disguise, although her kind treatment of Pluto indicates that she does not put much faith in this particular superstition. The narrator explicitly dismisses this viewpoint, but the superstition flavors his entire story. When he observes the image of the cat on the wall, he describes it as gigantic; he previously described Pluto as fairly large, but whether the size of the image is an expression of the paranormal or simply a product of his frightened imagination is difficult to say. The other popular notion relevant to this story is the belief that a cat has nine lives; this superstition becomes a part of the story when the second black cat is believed to be a reincarnation of the dead Pluto with only one slight but horrible modification — the imprint of the gallows on its breast but we have no evidence that the narrator is observing anything more than the twisting of his own mind. ***&#8221;The Black Cat&#8221; is in many ways a moral tale that deals with the tension between love and hate and that warns of the dangers of alcohol, a substance to which Poe himself was addicted for much of his life. The narrator appears at first to love both his wife and his pets, but by the end of the story his fondness has turned to neglect, spite, and even hatred, particularly for Pluto and his successor. Although Poe does not provide a solid explanation for the narrator&#8217;s encroaching loss of sanity, perhaps suggesting that madness might happen at any time to any person, the narrator admits the role of alcohol in his behavior. In addition, the arrival of the second cat is closely related to his alcoholism, since he first finds the cat in a seedy drinking establishment. The second cat ultimately serves as the facilitator of justice when it reveals the corpse&#8217;s hiding place at the end of the tale, and its initial appearance on top of a hogshead of gin or rum emphasizes its moral purpose. .<br></p>

<h3>The Dream of the Rood, one of the few surviving pieces of Anglo-Saxon literature, is a vital reference for the ambiguous culture of England&#8217;s early ancestors.</h3>



<p>It is one of the earliest Christian poems in Old English literature, and one of the earliest Christian poems in all of Anglo-Saxon literature. Both its author and its date of composition are unknown and surfaced in a late tenth-century manuscript found in Vercelli, which is in northern Italy. Argued as one of the oldest pieces of Old English Literature,&nbsp;The Dream of the Rood&nbsp;effectively embodies the blended culture, moral code, and religious values of its unknown author. In the poem the narrator recalls a vision he received in a dream, where he encounters the rood on which Christ was crucified.</p>



<p>***The authorship of the poem is lost to us. The names of Caedmon and Cynewulf have been proposed as authors, in part because they are two of the very few Anglo-Saxon Christian writers from the period whose names are known. Caedmon is known because the Venerable Bede talks about him in his history of the English church, written in the seventh century A.D., and it has been argued that no one else at the time could have written the rood poem.</p>



<p>***This is a story about someone who has a dream about the holy cross. He talks about how he sees a tree and there are angels that are looking over it. He says that the tree is surely not a tree made for sinful people but for someone with the Holy Spirit. The tree/cross is decked with gold and very ornate showing its importance. The dreamer acknowledges that the tree was once drenched with blood but is now adorned with treasure. The next part of the story says that the tree starts speaking. It tells its own story about its experience through the crucifixion. It tells how it was pierced with nails. It makes it seem like it had a choice to be a cross or not. It said that it had to follow Gods&#8217; word. The cross tells of how they mocked not just Jesus but both of them. The cross tells of how he was wounded with arrows when the roman soldiers took Jesus down from it. They laid him down, he went cold. Everything around the cross went quiet as the soldiers left. The last paragraph talks about how the cross now searches for glory. It doesn&#8217;t have many friends now because they are all in heaven. He says he will wait till the day the lord comes back. He will come back to get his cross. Until then he will dwell in glory. He finishes saying that everyone will rejoice when “Almighty God” comes back home.</p>



<p>Paganism vs. Christianity in “The Dream of the Rood”: The &#8220;Dream of the Rood&#8221; is certainly a very old English poem, perhaps one of the very first composed in our language at all. The version we have of it is found in a medieval Italian text called the Vercelli Book, which was written about the 10th century A.D. The poem brings, more than a thousand years earlier, a reverse image &#8211; that of a tree becoming the Cross. As the first example of Anglo-Saxon religious poetry in the form of a dream vision the poem is not just a conventional rendering of Christian dogmas in verse. The poem details the crucifixion of Christ from the viewpoint of the Rood.&nbsp;Christianity of course heavily influences the poem and there are&nbsp;also some paganistic elements as well.&nbsp; The rood&#8217;s dictation, steeped with references to both Pagan and Christian culture, implies the subservient relationship he shared with Christ as that of a lord and thane. Furthermore, the crucifixion scene is metaphorically illustrated as a battle and elevates both Christ and the rood to the warrior status reminiscent of Anglo-Saxon heroes. This contradictory concept of Christ as a self-sacrificing victim, yet fearless warrior king, coupled with the conflicting references to Pagan and Christian culture demonstrate the blended perspective of the poem&#8217;s author. Within the context of the poem, the clash between the newly emerging society of ecclesiastical ethics and Pagan tradition of heroism and warfare is evident.</p>



<p>The Dream of the&nbsp;Rood is first and foremost a Christian piece. J. A. Burrow has praised it as &#8220;one of the first and one of the most successful treatments in English of the theme of the Crucifixion.&#8221; The poem takes the form of a dream, which the narrator, an unnamed man, relates to the reader. While the term &#8220;rood&#8221; refers to a cross, the dream is really about a tree that has been fashioned into a cross. Specifically, the tree has been turned into the cross used to crucify Christ, and feels immense sorrow and pain at what he has become which he relates to the dreamer in a long passage. The poem&nbsp;details the death and resurrection of Christ, the triumph over sin and evil,&nbsp;and stresses the importance of the Rood or Cross as we know it.&nbsp; The death and resurrection of&nbsp;Christ is very important in the Christian religion, it is&nbsp;because Christ gave his life “to set free mankind” and to forgive mankind of their sins.</p>



<p>When Christ rose again on the third day he made his triumph over sin and evil and proved he was the true Son of God.&nbsp;The Rood shares this triumph with Christ over death. Instead of&nbsp;fearing death they face it refusing to bend or bow. The Bible says not to fear for the Lord is with you and&nbsp;the account of the Rood&nbsp;enforces this idea. Another Bible verse that enforces the idea of&nbsp;triumph over death in this poem is&nbsp;“He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will&nbsp;never die” (John 11:25-26). When Christ dies,</p>



<h3 style="text-align:center">“All of creation wept,/keened the king&#8217;s death./ Christ was on the cross”.</h3>



<p>The poem is heavily laden with references to pagan culture. For instance the dreamer recalls the cross telling him about the crucifixion as if it were a battle. Bernard F. Huppé has summarized this view, remarking that &#8220;the Crucifixion is pictured as a battle and both Christ and the Cross as warriors, whose deaths are victories, and whose burials are preludes to the triumph of their Resurrections.&#8221; Additionally, the poem presents Christ as a heroic warrior. The narrator regards the willing sacrifice of Christ&#8217;s life as a triumph and embodies Christ with the courage, honor, and might of a traditional Anglo-Saxon king. While the rod explains that he could have easily &#8220;felled all the enemies&#8221; for Christ, Christ instead willingly, “eager to mount the gallows,/ Unafraid in the sight of manu:/ He would set free mankind”. With this action Christ proves himself a heroic being, determined to carry out God&#8217;s divine plan, even if it means losing his life in the process.</p>



<p>Like all Anglo-Saxon heroes, Christ submits himself to the winds of fate and gains immorality. The rood, like a burial mound, becomes a symbol of Christ&#8217;s triumph. Christ can also be seen as an Anglo-Saxton warrior lord, who&nbsp;is served by his thanes, especially on the cross and who rewards them at the feast of glory in Heaven. Christ is addressed here as “mankind’s brave king”, “Bringer of Victory”, “most high Prince”, “Prince of Glory”. Thus, the crucifixion of Christ is a victory because Christ could have fought his enemies, but he chose to die on the cross.</p>



<p>Throughout the poem there are strong suggestions of a lord/ thane relationship between Christ and the rood, where the rood is presented as a selfless retainer of Christ. The relationship is subtlety suggested when the dreamer witnesses the rood began to bleed on the right side as Christ had, implying the inseparable connection between lord and thane. This bond is later solidified when the rood and Christ are depicted in battle together and the rood obediently follows the desires of his lord, recalling that he did &#8220;I dared not break or bend aside/ against God’s will&#8221;. At the conclusion of the poem, the narrator himself accepts this lord/thane relationship with Christ. Just as the lords of ancient times presented thanes with treasures for their service, the poet regards this vision of the gold-enameled cross as a gift from God and is thus bound by the Anglo-Saxon code of conduct to serve Christ. Besides this image as Christ as a warrior king, the very idea of a talking tree is incredibly animisitc, referring to the way in which pagan elements incorporate spirits and other fantastical elements of nature.&nbsp;Paganism puts a great emphasis on the spiritual elements that embody various things in Mother Nature. Specifically in the poem, this belief that natural objects possess a spirit or spiritual elements urges the reader recognize the tree as an object of worship.&nbsp;When christs followers found the tree or rood they “grit me with gold and silver”. The tree&#8217;s triumph over death is thus celebrated by adorning the cross with gold and jewels, in a way worshipping the&nbsp;tree as if it were an idol, remembering the days of pagan&#8217;s faith in idolatry. The cross goes on to tell us that it was richly adorned with &#8220;treasure,&#8221; which was gold, as a warrior would expect, and the blood of Jesus, which a theologian would expect. Often in Anglo-Saxon&#8217;s heroic literature, weapons are given personalities. The physical image of a cross is very similar to that of a sword, which was often given personalities. Famous swords such as Hrunting, belonging to Beowulf, became symbols of power and kingship. Similarly the Rood becomes the symbol of Christ’s kingly power. This would explain the extravagant appearance of the Rood, as powerful swords were personified as loyal retainers entitled to receive treasures as the symbol of their service. This takes the form of gold and gems with which they are adorned. This also gives us the combined images of the Rood as Christ’s retainer, and Christ as the Ring-Giver, “great king” or lord. One can note that in this story, the cross suffers along with Christ, even bearing wounds from arrows. While the Gospel story has no arrows, the Saxons would have assumed that any great battle must have had them in plenty, and the cross had to take its fair share of the warrior&#8217;s suffering. But, of course, in the Christian story, Christ rises from the dead. And just like a brave and victorious king who shares the spoils of war with his loyal thanes, so too Christ the king shares his victory with the cross, who has served him as a fellow warrior in combat. The Cross then goes on to address everyone, as fellow warriors in the great struggle. He tells us, doubtless imagining us sitting around the council&#8217;s hearth fire, drinking our mead and listening to the scops, or the bards sing the ballads of our ancestors. The cross says to the listening warriors,</p>



<h3>“Now I command you, my beloved warrior,/ that you tell this vision to men,/reveal in words that it is the tree of glory,/ on which Almighty God suffered/ for mankind&#8217;s many sins/ and Adam&#8217;s deeds of old”.</h3>



<p>Despite these strong pagan elements, the very&nbsp;nature of&nbsp;The Dream of the Rood&nbsp;is based upon Christian belief. The entire poem deals with the passion, death and resurrection of Christ&nbsp;acting as a triumph over sin and evil. Here the dreamer realizes that Christ&#8217;s death was not some victory in battle, but was in fact a way in which human salvation&nbsp;was secured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personifying an inanimate object is typical of the medieval tradition in which swords, mead and the like are personified in riddles. Riddles were typically told in the mead hall as entertainment for the thanes. By using the cross as a narrator, the poet uses a common medieval technique that would help to appease and entertain the audience.In addition to the cross&#8217;s warrior-like description, he also possesses another Anglo-Saxon quality. He possesses the ability to boast. The author personified the cross itself to speak about the death and resurrection of Jesus. As &#8220;The Dream of the Rood&#8217;s&#8221; many deviations from the biblical account of the crucifixion suggest, the image of Christ in the Middle Ages emphasized the salvation Christ brought to mankind by presenting him as a triumphant warrior over sin. The depiction of Christ receiving a Beowulf-type burial rather than the type of burial recorded in the gospels shows how the image of Christ in the Middle Ages had been adapted from the image of Christ recorded in the gospels. Rather than presenting Christ as a lamb or a passive participant in the universal plan for redemption, the poet presents Christ as a martyred hero, an image that reflects the preeminent values of the early medieval society. The appearance of the cross and the way in which the cross&#8217;s experiences are told are strikingly different from traditional Christian ideas. Instead, the description in the poem is rather Anglo-Saxon.In the Christian tradition that preaches humility and deemphasizes riches, this description of the cross does not seem to fit. To the mind of the Anglo-Saxon on the other hand, this would sound appealing. Blood, arrows, gashes, treasure, and gold would all spark an interest to the Anglo-Saxon culture. The poem creates a warrior-like Lamb of God and a strongly medieval afterlife.Although the ideas of humility and selflessness may not fit neatly into Anglo-Saxon society, this poem finds a way to convince the audience of Christian values. A dream vision or visio is a literary device in which a dream or vision is recounted as having revealed knowledge or a truth that is not available to the dreamer or visionary in a normal waking state. Anonymous, The Dream of the Rood – the guide in Dream of the Rood is the Cross on which Christ was crucified. This genre typically follows a structure whereby a narrator recounts his experience of falling asleep, dreaming, and waking, and the story is often an allegory. The dream, which forms the subject of the poem, is prompted by events in his waking life that are referred to early in the poem. In the course of the dream, the narrator, often with the aid of a guide, is offered perspectives that provide potential resolutions to his waking concerns.The Dream of the Rood has three parts: the Dreamer’s account of his vision of the Cross, the Rood’s monologue describing the Crucifixion, and the Dreamer’s resolution to seek the salvation of the Cross.In the end, the Dreamer is renewed with hope and vows to seek again the glorious Rood. The dream-vision convention was widely used in European literature from late Latin times until the 15th century. The dream vision uses strong, virile images of Christ in order to reach members of the Anglo-Saxon warrior culture, who valued strength above humility. This may have been a deliberate strategy to convert pagans to Christianity. The Dream of the Rood draws with astonishing creativity at the secular heroic ethos. &#8220;The Dream of the Cross&#8221; has been called &#8220;one of the great religious poems of the English language,&#8221; the finest dream-allegory in Anglo-Saxon as well as one of the earliest extant versions of the medieval dream-vision, and hailed as a portrayal of Christ &#8220;as a truly heroic Germanic warrior with his disciples as his loyal comitatus.&#8217; &#8220;The Dream of the Cross&#8221; is therefore a powerful argument for the spiritual qualities of honor, truth, and courage which marked the Anglo-Saxon mind before Christianity and the spiritual qualities of mercy, justice, and love after Christianity had spread. Cross has faith &amp; is like a thane. The Dream of the Rood also provides a valuable window into early Christian Anglo-Saxon England/Britain. Like most Old English poetry, it is written in alliterative verse. Preserved in the 10th century Vercelli Book discovered, in 1822, northern Italy the poem may be as old as the 8th century Ruthwell Cross, a large stone carving dating to the early eighth century. Eighteen verses of The Dream of the Rood were carved into the cross in runic lettering and it is considered one of the oldest works of Old English literature. The Dream of the Rood and the gospel tales of the crucifixion are separated not only by time, but by culture, language and depiction of the nature of Christ. The most obvious difference is that it is told from the POV of the cross whilst the biblical gospels are described by the apostles. In spite of this, there are clear parallels between the 2 accounts of crucifixion &#8211; both detail Christ&#8217;s death as a triumph of good over evil and redemption of mankind as a positive. Thus, these accounts follow the same event, but employ widely different methods of narration to explore greater themes.</p>

<h5>Restoration Comedy of Manners: “The Way of the World” which is written by William Congreve (1670-1729), remiered in 1700, is the most apposite example of comedy of manners with its witty dialogues between the characters, criticism of the upper class people’s manners and also satiric and effective scenes and proviso scene that ends in a lyrical celebration of unity. This comedy contains almost all the qualities which we find in a Restoration comedy and thus representing the peak and the perfection of this type of comedy. It presents a vast vista of contemporary social morality and principles and maintains a satirical tone from the beginning to the end. It gives us valuable information about the sophisticated class of society in England at that time.</h5>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The Comedy of Manners also termed as a Restoration comedy is a witty and cerebral form of dramatic comedy that depicts and often satirizes the manners and affectations of a contemporary society. “The comedy of manners deals with the relations and intrigues of men and women living in a sophisticated upper-class society, and relies for comic effect in large part on the wit and sparkle of the dialogue—often in the form of repartee, a witty conversational give-and-take which constitutes a kind of verbal fencingmatch—as well as on the violations of social standards and decorum by would be wits, jealous husbands, conniving rivals, and foppish dandies”. The themes of the Restoration comedy of manners are love, marriage, adulterous relationships amours and legacy conflicts; and the characters generally include would be wits, jealous husbands, conniving rivals foppish dandies, fanatics, fools, imitators of French customs, conceited wits, and flirts. These plays are often centered around love and adultery and include gossip, eavesdropping, and scheming. Conversation is often witty and ironic. The Restoration period was an age of loose morals and, and was devoid of moral values. The Way of the World contains this current through the illicit love and adulterous relations – e.g. relation between Fainall and Mrs. Marwood, between Mirabell, the hero, and Mrs. Fainal. Mirabell married Mrs. Fainall off to Fainal, being afraid of her being pregnant. Fainall’s illicit relationship with Mrs. Marwood having been exposed, Fainall faces the situation fearlessly and shamelessly: “If it must all come out, why let ‘them know it; it’s but the way of the world.” Even Mrs. Marwood and Lady Wishfort secretly loved Mirabell. Unhappy conjugal life can be treated as another characteristic of the time which is expressed through the relation between Mr. and Mrs. Fainall. One of them feels uneasy in the presence of another. Mrs. Fainall expresses her uneasiness in St ames’s park in the presence of her husband- “He turned sort upon me unaware, and had almost overcome me.” The institution of marriage was always held to ridicule. Both husbands and wives openly expressed their dissatisfaction of their spouses. Mrs. wood says, “I have done hating &#8217;em, and am now come to despise &#8217;em;&nbsp;the next thing I have to do is eternally to forget em.” The Way of The World also exposes the worldliness and greed of the young men of the time. Mercenary motives led them to seek rich heiresses in marriage. Mr. Fainall marries Mrs. Fainall, a widow, for her property. Mirabell does not want to marry Millament without her property. This mercenary tendency led them to intrigue which was the order of the day in social and domestic life. Mirabell, in order to obtain Milament with her whole legacy, pretends to woo Lady Wishfort. He marries off his servant to Wishfort’s maid and sends his servant as Sir Roland to Lady Wishfort so that the servant can make a marriage contact with the lady. Even Sir Wilfull, an exception to other characters of the play, joins the web of intrigues in the play. Moreover, Fainall makes the legacy-conflict deeper through his cruel condition to Lady Wishfort. In The Way of The World, we are acquainted with the vanities, affectations and fashions of the time. Mirrabell satirically remarks in the proviso scene on women’s fondness of wearing masks, going to the theatre with or without their husbands’ knowledge, idle gossip, slandering the absent friends etc. In her contact with Mirabell, Millament proves her habit of late rising, contemplation in solitude general laziness etc. She says, “I’ll ye abed in a morning as long as I please.” Mirabell also ridicules pregnant women’s wearing tight dresses in order to maintain their figure. Moreover, intelligent women like Millament allowed a crowd of admirers to a school of fools to gather around them in order to show their demand and worth. Millament’s vanity is revealed in causing her lover pain to have a sense of power: “One’s cruelty is one’s power.” Above all, Lady Wishfort, a higher class fashionable lady, seeks a husband in her age of fifty five. Mirabell ridicules her saying, “The good lady would marry anything that resembled a men.” And the make up and dressing up of women of the society is expressed in the speech of the footman about Lady Wishfort of the house- “I cannot swear to her face in a morning, before she is dressed.” The upper class people could give up anything only to maintain/save the family name and fame. Lady Wishfort wants to conceal the scandal of her daughter by any means. She says, “I’ll compound, I’ll give up all, myself and my all, my niece and her all- anything, everything for composition.” The Way of The World brings before us witty Restoration ladies and gentlemen even their servants and fools are witty. As a result, the dialogue is throughout witty which is something unrealistic.. Therefore the play, like other plays of its kind, is called an ‘artificial’ comedy. From Footman’s speech we know about frequent changing of servantsin that society. Asked by Willfull about how long he is here, the Footman replies, “A week sir: longer than anybody in the house, except my lady’s woman.” Complicated plot construction is also regarded as a quality of comedy of manners. In this play, the five acts contain sixty five scenes in total, and there are very complicated relations among the characters. Such as, Mirabell, the hero is loved by Millament, Mrs. Fainall, Mrs. Marwood, and even Lady Wishfort secretly. He had a relation with Mrs. Fainall, onced tried to woo Lady wishfort and now trying to marry Millament. Witty dialogue and repartee are perhaps the most important features of the Comedy of Manners. The best example of a scene of witty dialogue is the &#8216;proviso&#8217; scene in which Millamant specifies her conditions before she agrees to accept Mirabell as her husband and he in turn also states his conditions. Millamant insists, “Let us be as strange as if we had been married a great while, and as well-bred as if we were not married at all.” To sum up, the whole plot of the play revolves around the issues of adultery, marriage and fortune hunting and mocks the society, or in other ways lift up society for scrutiny, which could cause negative or positive results. Congreve’s writing style shows both intelligence and sympathy with his creativity of the characters fixed with the aspects of the Restoration Comedy. The selfish, absurd and unbalanced manners of the characters are criticises clearly with the ironic and satiric usage of Congreve. Also, the importance of witty dialogues cannot be disregarded as the absolute proofs of the comedy of manners. The discussion above makes it very much clear that The Way of the World presents a faithful picture of the manners of the restoration period and the eighteenth century social picture. Though when the play was first performed in 1700 it was not a huge success, but later on it was realized that the play is a classic example of comedy of manners and Congreve’s “magnum opus” or master work. Major Themes: The themes of The way of the world: After Charles II revived theater in 1660, a new kind of comedy, the comedy of manners exploded onto the English drama scene and remained the preferred style of theater for the rest of the century. The aim of these plays was to mock society, or rather to hold it up for scrutiny by those very people whose social world was being characterized on stage. The Way of the World reflects Congreve&#8217;s personal view of Restoration society and city life, full of its artificiality, rigidity, and formality. As is typical of Restoration Theater, this play&#8217;s main themes are centered around that of marriage, money, love, social reputation, artificiality in manners, law, legacy conflicts, conspiracy, double status, adulterous relationships amours; and the characters generally include would be wits, jealous husbands, conniving rivals and foppish dandies. Love a la Mode: Certainly, the play can be seen as a dramatic presentation of varieties of love in the England of the year 1700. Central is the delicate handling of the love game as played by Mirabell and Millamant. They represent the ideal of the Restoration attitude, intense yet balanced, their love based on mutual esteem with no surrender of individuality. Contrasted with it are Mirabell&#8217;s earlier and quite ambiguous love affair with Mrs. Fainall; the illicit love of Fainall and Mrs. Marwood, presumably passionate, but wholly without mutual trust; the spurious court young Witwoud pays to Millamant; the direct and somewhat coarse approach of Sir Wilfull; and, at the opposite extreme completely, the aging and undignified longings of Lady Wishfort, vain, unrealistic, over-eager, desperate, and a little pathetic. Love and Money: Money is a distinct concern for several of the characters in Congreve’s play. In the world whose way is presented here, love and money are values to be taken into account at all times. The sentiment of love itself is not enough to build a romantic relationship on or to protect family bonds. Money is actually an indispensible ingredient of love as money provides for a comfortable life, which then allows one to enjoy one’s love. The dominant Restoration attitude was that while love is important, but it must not obscure the importance of money. Mirabell’s love for Millament is genuine, but he will not let the ‘moiety’ of her fortune go. The sincerity of Mirabell&#8217;s love does not make him lose sight of the importance of Millamant&#8217;s fortune. Fainall marries for money to support an illicit love; apparently the thought of marrying Mrs. Marwood without adequate money is unthinkable. Money is Lady Wishfort&#8217;s sole hold over her child and her ward. Even the marriage of the servants itself is also a testament to this theme. It is built on a promise of a handsome sum of money. This is the world&#8217;s way. Love without money is an impossible sentimental dream, although money often corrupts what love there is. Marriage: Marriages are central thematic concerns as Mirabell’s machinations are fuelled by his desire to marry Millamant, and Fainall uses his marriage to try to extract money from his mother-in-law, Lady Wishfort. The state of marriage is depicted as simultaneously desirable, and yet to be avoided as a trap should be. These aspects of marriage are used to comic effect, but the play ends finally with a warning against falsehood in the marriage bed and so reminds the readers and the audience that it is dishonesty in marriage rather than marriage that has been questioned here. Dishonesty and disloyalty is depicted as a core feature of marriage in Way of the world. Mrs. Fainall had a relationship with Mirabel but married Fainall to avoid rumours or unwanted pregnancy… Mr. Fiannal and Mrs. Marwood has an adulterous relationship though Mr. Fainall is married to … Marriage was dependent on the social status, money and power that the individuals possessed. It was unheard of, at that time, to marry solely for love. The highly contrived plot of&nbsp;The Way of the World&nbsp;reflects these preoccupations with money and status. Even though Mirabell loves Millament, he is unwilling to let go of her inheritance. The entire plot is designed to allow the two to marry with Lady Wishfort’s permission. While marriages are important economic contracts, they are also convenient vehicles for protecting social reputations. Mrs. Fainall has made such a marriage, which is socially acceptable and even expected, as long as the pretense of civility is maintained. Jungle of High Intrigue: In this play everyone is engaged in intrigue: Mirabell intrigues to gain consent to his marriage from Lady Wishfort, and this involves intrigue within intrigue, for he does not trust Waitwell. Fainall intrigues in turn. Everyone is involved in one or the other of these schemes&#8211;Mrs. Fainall, Mrs. Marwood, and the servants. Even Lady Wishfort in her willingness to marry Sir Rowland has a devious purpose&#8211;revenge on Mirabell. When Mrs. Fainall married her husband, that was part of an intrigue, as was his marriage to her. And as we see in the play, victory goes to Mirabell, not because of his virtue, but simply because he is the most successful intriguer. Social Etiquette and Reputation: &#8220;Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous actions? To save that idol, reputation.&#8221; (Act II, Scene II) A Comedy of Manners is named as such to call attention to one of its most central themes &#8211; manners, or social etiquette, and the comedy that can ensue because of the importance, especially to the upper class during the Restoration, of preserving one&#8217;s position in society. In the climax of the play, the actions and reactions largely stop being concerned with love or even money, and what Lady Wishfort seems to fear most is a loss of good reputation for herself and her daughter. Much of the demonstrated love seen in the show &#8211; for example, Witwoud and Petulant&#8217;s love for Ms. Millamant &#8211; is done purely in hopes of raising one&#8217;s reputation. Fun is made of social etiquette especially in the acting of Petulant, Sir Wilfull, and Sir Rowland, three characters that to varying degrees are unable to live up to upper class standards, but must try to put on a show for others. Friendship: Same-gender and opposite gender friendships are called into question in this play, as it is said and demonstrated that none of these relationships is particularly strong or trusting. The women-women and men-men pairings, though originally posing as friends, join schemes against one another based mostly on money and reputation. As for women-men pairings, we do not see many in the play that are not based on either mutual love or the love of one and disdain of the other. Certainly, friendship is as falsely fashionable and tactical as anything else in the play. Social Convention: Congreve&#8217;s ‘‘comedy of manners’’ takes the fashionable or conventional social behavior of the time as the principle subject of satire. Conflicts that arise between and among characters are prompted by affected and artificial social mores, especially with respect to relationships between the sexes. Social pretenses and plot complications abound in&nbsp;The Way of the World. Women are compelled to act coyly and to dissemble in courtship; couples deceive one another in marriage; friends are double-dealing, and conquests have more to do with dowries and convenience than love. All moral principle is risked for the sake of reputation and money. However, what makes the action comic is the subterfuge. What one says is hardly ever what one really thinks or means. To judge by appearances, for example, no one could be happier in his marriage than Fainall, who in reality disdains his wife and is carrying on an adulterous affair with his wife&#8217;s close friend. Congreve intimates that, in fashionable society at the turn of the eighteenth century, it is crucial to preserve the outer trappings of beauty, wit, and sophistication no matter how egregious one&#8217;s actions and words might prove. Significance of the title: “The Way of the World” which is written by William Congreve (1670-1729), premiered in 1700, is the most apposite example of comedy of manners with its witty dialogues between the characters, criticism of the upper class people’s manners and also satiric and effective scenes that ends in a lyrical celebration of unity. The title of this play is significant because it points to one of the major themes of the play &#8212; it sort of signals to us what the play is about. The way of the word generally means, the manner in which people typically behave or things typically happen. The play is a &#8220;comedy of manners&#8221; in which the playwright pokes fun at the social customs and values of his time.&nbsp; He makes fun of marriages and dowries and he makes fun of the way men and women behave towards each other. The title of the play is rightly suitable, first, it is inspired by the then social period during which the play was originally performed. Secondly, as a comedy of manners, it makes fun of human follies and silly social behaviors. But some critics also suggest that The Way of the World&nbsp;points to the ‘way’ the hero and heroine should adopt in order to come out of the grip of the fashionable society. The entire play is set in London and this urban setting keeps especial importance. It basically represents metropolitan aristocratic society and ridiculed people for their lack of sophistication.&nbsp; The Act 1 begins in the chocolate house where many people come to enjoy. Similarly, Act II begins in St. James Park. The park suggests something as freedom. This is a public place where basically fashionable people use to go to exchange their heart and to be free. Act III, too, begins in Lady Wishforts’ house, but the very scene is in the toilet. Remaining inside the toilet, Lady Wishfort is talking to Peg in serious matters. It clearly shows that how restoration people take the serious things lightly. In Act IV, lady Wishfort and Foible are talking the arrival of Sir Roland. Lady Wishfort orders to Foible to arrange the things in order and she also asks for dancer and musician if he (Sir Roland) wants to entertain. It is the showy nature of the Restoration period (people). Because people like Lady Wishfort is very much concerned on how to perceive and impress man in his first visit. As a result, she talks how to sit, how to walk, how to talk in front of him. She says, ‘I will walk from the door upon his entrance and how do I look?’ These some events clearly show that how the restoration people are very pedantic in their fashion and outer appearance. In the same way, in another scene, Millamant talks with her lover Mirabell that she does not like to be familiar or found, she rejects to go any park not she plays together, even after the marriage, and she wants to be like unmarried one. Likewise, she wants liberty to write letters, to receive letters, to talk with a lover, to have dinner with him and to bring him in her dressing room. Even her husband must knock the door, before entering the room if her lover is inside the room. These are the general condition she talks with Mirabell before getting married. This is what actually the Restoration period was. In the play male characters are pursuing women. We can take the instance of Mirabell, Witwood, Petuland and Fainall who seem adulterous and deceptive. It was because fashionable to court a young and beautiful woman in the contemporary society. In the play, everyone plots against everyone and deceives everyone. And the play begins, we know that Mirabell pretends to love Lady Wishfort in order to be touched with Millamant, the single heir of the property. Mr. Finall, the fortune hunter is also committed to get Millament’s fortune at hand. We find the characters in disguise and they do their best to be what they are not. To pretend to be what one is not is the way of the world. So, the title itself suggests the manner of Restoration urban aristocrats. The very title of the play,&nbsp;The Way of the World&nbsp;points to the ‘way’ the hero and heroine should adopt in order to come out of the grip of the fashionable society. The whole story is an illustration of the process, by following which Mirabell and Millament seek a resolution, that is, to gain their own world by using and manipulating the existing social norms, through the winding lanes of that society. Congreve constructed the plot of the play accordingly with this aim in mind. One can discern a definite pattern in the movement of the play. At the beginning of the play, Mirabell is trying to shape up a situation so that he can win both hands of Millament and her estate from Lady Wishfort. He has married his servant, Waitwell off to Lady Wishfort’s maid, Foible and plans to have Waitwell disguise himself as a noble man, court, and marry Lady Wishfort. Then Mirabell would blackmail her by threatening to disclose that she has married a servant and would offer her to release her if she will let him marry Millament plus the estate. But Mrs. Marwood discovers the plan and tells Lady Wishfort. Mrs. Marwood also tells Fainwall of his wife, Mrs. Fainwall’s former relationship with Mirabell. From all these Fainwall plans to blackmail Lady Wishfort by threatening to reveal all unless she signs over to him not only his wife’s but also Millament’s estate and even the conversation of Lady Wishfort’s own estate after her death. As the action of the play gets momentum and the plot becomes more and more complicated, Congreve loads the stage by introducing confusing figures like Mr. Wilful Witwood. While it adds to the comedy of the play, it complicates the plot further. However, certain hidden facts of the past are revealed through the conversations of the characters: for instance, Mrs. Marwood’s desire for Mirabell, Mrs. Marwood’s relationship with Fainall, Mirabell’s past affair with Mrs. Fainall etc. Congreve measures these secrets slowly person by person, until the final revelation in Act V, where all pretences are destroyed Mr. Fainall’s and Mirabell’s revelations, and the bringing out from a black box of the deed renders Mr. Fainall powerless. The complexities and complications are, however, deliberate on Congreve’s part; for he wanted to present his Restoration audience a play that can coincide artistically with the artificialities and complexities in the human affairs of the period. The chief aim of the dramatist is to demonstrate “the way of the world”. Following this way Mirabell and Millament, through their own peculiar balance of wit and generosity of spirit, reduce the bumbling Witwood and Mr. Fainall to the same level of false wit. Thus the pair dramatise the true wit that is carefully and symmetrically defined through their opposition. They are aware of the fact that they are making compromises in their marriage. Mirabell says, “…I like her with all her faults: nay, I like her for her faults…They are now grown familiar to me as my own frailties…” And Millament charmingly declares, “Well, if Mirabell should not make a good husband, I am lost thing—find I love him violently.” These confidences do not prevent their own chances for honesty in marriage. In the Proviso Scene they arrange an agreement for their marriage. The reason is obvious: that is, marriage is a social contract that would enable them to rise above the cant and hypocrisy that surround them. The triumph of the play is in the emergence of lovers who through a balance of intense affection and cool self-knowledge achieve an equilibrium that frees them from the world’s power. As the title of the play&nbsp;The Way of the World&nbsp;suggests, they have assimilated the rational lucidity of skeptical rake so that they can use the world and reject its demands. Beneath the surface of proper English society are layers of deceit, greed, vanity, pretension, silliness, desire for revenge, and indecorous romance. Congreve&#8217;s sharp wit pierces this surface to reveal society as it is, with all its faults, foibles, follies, and bitter rivalries. He shows the reader “the way of the world.&#8221; Proviso Scene: It was quite common for Restoration comedies to have Proviso scenes, that is, scenes where the hero and heroine define a set of rules which they would like the other to follow in order to facilitate a balanced relationship. In a way they are setting the parameters of an equal marriage. the Proviso Scene is one of the most remarkable aspects of William Congreve&#8217;s(1670-1729) &#8220;The Way of the World&#8221;(1700). In Act 4 of The Way of the World, couple Mirabell and Millamont find themselves in a battle of wit as they discuss the terms of their marriage. This scene, called the proviso scene, gives important insight into Mirabell and Millamont&#8217;s relationship. The terms of both characters illustrate their concerns and fears for their future marriage. The scene is a pure comedy with brilliant display of wit by both of them, but, above all, provides instructions which have serious dimensions in the context of the society. Mirabell and Millament both are well-acquainted with the ‘Way of the World’, and see the Provisos as a way to a stable future, where both can have their freedom. They lay down a set of rules which they would like the other to comply to. Mirabell sounds patronising and sententious, yet his provisos reveal that he is not altogether insensitive. He reveals his thoughtfulness and his foresight when he declares that he wants no intrigue in his house, and if that condition is fulfilled, he would agree to be a “tractable and complying husband”. Mirabell and Millamant’s marriage will be different from the other relationships in the play because it would be based on mutual respect and love. The nature of their provisos shows their genuine love for each other.&nbsp;They will forge a new Way of the World with their marriage and the Provisos each sets for the other shows that they genuinely care for each other and are keen to be faithful in their marriage. Through this scene appears very funny but it is a serious comment on the degradation of conjugal relations. The conditions as set down by the two lovers, confirm the sincerity of their motives and their wish to live a married life which was different from others. Both of them accept each other&#8217;s conditions. It is a guideline or memorandum of understanding between a husband and a wife, which would enable them to spend a happy married life. According to Millamant’s first condition, she wants equal amount of love and affection on the part of her would husband throughout her life. Behind her conditions one can notice the pitiable condition of a wife after marriage. Just before marriage when men and women are lovers they declare full support and love for each other but things take a turn when they marry each other. So Millamant appears anxious because of this reason and that is why she puts this condition. Again, Millamant says that she hates those lovers who do not take proper care of their beloveds. She further wants that her husband must be a loyal and good natured man.&nbsp; Millamants conditions shows that they will compromise but won’t bid adieu to their individuality and freedom. Millamant says to Mirabell that she wants her liberty after her marriage; she informs Mirabell that she can&#8217;t forgo her independence, she says, &#8220;My dear liberty, shall I leave thee? My faithful solitude, my darling contemplation, must I bid you adiue?&#8230; My morning, thoughts, agreeable wakings, indolent slumbers, all ye douceurs, &#8230; Adieu &#8212; I can&#8217;t do it, &#8217;tis more than impossible.&#8221; She also adds that &#8220;I will lie a bed in a morning as long as I please&#8221;. Even she demands that she can receive and pay visits and letters to anyone she pleases. In the former scene one can see that Mr. and Mrs. Fainal, though don’t have any love or care for each other, addresses each other as “my dear”, “my soul” in public just to go with the flow of social decorum. But Millament criticizes this public “show off” and informs that she would not like to be addressed by such names as “wife, spouse, my dear, joy, jewel, love, sweet-heart; and the rest of that nauseous can, in which men and their wives are so fulsomely familiar.” Moreover, they will continue to present a decorous appearance in public. In other words, after marriage they maintain certain distance and reserve between them. She says, “Let us be as strange as if we had been marry’d a great while; and as well bred as if we are not marry’d at all.” Each of Mirabell’s provisos begin with its item: first, the general principle, “that your Acquaintance be general”, then specific instructions, “no she-friend to screen her affairs”, no fop to take her to the theatre secretly, and an illustration of the forbidden behaviour, “to wheedle you a fop-scrambling to the play in a mask”. Nevertheless, Mirabell denounces the use of tight dresses during pregnancy by women, and he forbids the use of alcoholic drinks. Though at first his conditions seems patronizing gradually they proved his genuine love and concern for her. The conditions are stated by both parties in a spirit of fun and gaiety, but the fact remained that both are striving to arrive at some kind of mutual understanding. Mirabells conditions also mocked some flaws in social practices. In that century women used to put a heavy makeup to hide their flaws which consume a lot of time and energy. Act III scene I is a nice example of this practice. But Mirabell criticizes this practice by one of his conditions. He says Millamant should not use the artificial things to cover her real appearance. On that time people used to pay visits to one another and specially women used to criticize one another behind one’s back. One of Mirabell’s “article”s was, Millamant should not be in company of any woman who has a notorious background or who indulges in scandalous activities. This condition revels the practice of backbiting of the people of that time. In Congreve’s “The Way of the World” Congreve seems to come to realise the importance for providing an ideal pair of man and woman, ideal in the sense that the pair could be taken for models in the life-style of the period. In fact, it serves as an excellent medium through which Congreve conveys his message to his readers. The lovers negotiate in this scene for a mutual private happiness within the confines of a rigid and demanding social context and they establish their relationship upon the possibility of such reconciliation. They manage to be sincere in a world full of pretence and their love is in any case true love.<br></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>raby is a short story by modernist writer James Joyce (1882 to 1941) which was published in 1914. As with many stories by Joyce and other modernist writers, &#8216;Araby&#8217; employs a close first-person narrator describing the world as it appeals to his senses, and leaves the reader with only a suggested, rather than outright, moral resolution. James Joyce&#8217;s “Araby” is a short story centering on an Irish adolescent emerging from boyhood fantasies into the harsh realities of everyday life in his country. The story “Araby” conveys the idea that the personal feelings of a person and the real world are two different things. The writer has described the intensity of the schoolboy’s love at various places in the story. Boy of about twelve who becomes infatuated with the sister of his friend, Mangan. He has friends, keeps active, and nurtures a dream: to win the attentions of the Mangan girl. Although she hardly notices him and converses with him only a few casual words, she is constantly in his thoughts even though they had never had a conversation. Finally, a day comes when she speaks to him andout of his childness and lack of knowledge about reality he tells her that if he goes to the bazaar called Araby, he will bring back something for her. After that day he can think of nothing but her and of the gift he will buy her at the bazaar. The protagonist has a series of romantic ideas, about the girl and the wondrous event that he will attend on her behalf. For him, she is an exotic, lovely creature, foreign to Dublin. And the bazaar—Araby, as it is called—represents a distant, mystical land to which he will travel on behalf of his beloved to obtain for her a splendid keepsake. Here Joyce provides the protagonist with a specific, dramatic conflict that is the need to impress Mangan&#8217;s sister with a gift from Araby. Though apparently minor, this desire is compelling because it is so intensely felt by him. Then the writer puts roadblocks in the way of the boy and the reader: the wait for Saturday itself, and then for the uncle&#8217;s return from work. After a long wait begins the agonizingly slow journey itself, which seems to take place in slow motion, like a nightmare. When he finally does arrive, the bazaar is more or less over. The boy has arrived too late to do any serious shopping, but quickly we see that his tardiness does not matter. Any nice gift is well beyond the protagonist&#8217;s price range. In this moment, he suddenly awakens to the bleakness of the humdrum life around him. We know, from the description of the boy&#8217;s housing situation and the small sum his uncle gives him, that their financial situation is tight. Though his anticipation of the event has provided him with pleasant daydreams, reality is much harsher. He remains a prisoner of his modest means and his city. His fantasies about the bazaar and buying a great gift for the girl are revealed as ridiculous. For one thing, the bazaar is a rather tawdry shadow of the boy&#8217;s dreams. He overhears the conversation of some of the vendors, who are ordinary English women, and the mundane nature of the talk drives home that there is no escape: bazaar or not, the boy is still in Dublin, and the accents of the vendors remind the reader that Dublin is a colonized city. Like the bazaar that offers experiences that differ from everyday Dublin, Mangan’s sister intoxicates the narrator with new feelings of joy and elation. Though he promises Mangan’s sister that he will go to Araby and purchase a gift for her, these mundane realities undermine his plans and ultimately thwart his desires. The narrator arrives at the bazaar only to encounter flowered teacups and English accents, not the freedom of the enchanting East. As the bazaar closes down, he realizes that his relationship with Mangan’s sister will also remain just a wishful idea and that his infatuation was as misguided as his fantasies about the bazaar. And he also realizes that it was his “vanity” when he promised to bring something for her. It is the sense of reality that makes his “eyes burn with anguish and anger”. ***The theme of the story “Araby” is that the subjective feelings of a person and the objective world are two opposing things. There is no agreement between them. When we read the story “Araby” carefully, we find that two opposing ideas have been presented. The first idea is schoolboy’s subjective feelings and the second idea is his objective or real world. There is a conflict between the personal feelings of a person and the real world. The boy falls in love with his friend’s sister. To him his subjective feeling of love is the only reality. All the other things have no importance for him. To him the serious work of live is a child’s play. He keeps on thinking about her all the time. Even when he goes to market, he thinks about her. In the classroom, he cannot pay attention to his studies. Nothing is important for him now. He usually weeps without knowing why he is weeping. He promises to buy a gift for the girl. These are the subjective feelings of the boy. This is his illusion. His objective world is that he is just a schoolboy. Perhaps he is an orphan too. His uncle is his patron. He should not have promised the girls to bring something for her. He cannot buy anything for her because he himself is dependent on his uncle. Therefore, we see that there is a big disagreement between his subjective feelings and objective world. It is only at the end of the story that he comes to know what he is and what he should not have done. He is disillusioned. With his little money, he cannot buy anything for her. It was his vanity when he promised to bring something for her. It is the sense of reality that makes his eyes burn with anguish and anger. ***Some critics have suggested that Mangan&#8217;s sister represents Ireland itself, and that therefore the boy&#8217;s quest is made on behalf of his native country. Certainly, the bazaar seems to combine elements of the Catholic Church and England. As the church has hypnotized its adherents, Araby has &#8220;cast an Eastern enchantment&#8221; over the boy. Moreover, it is &#8220;not some Freemason [Protestant] affair.&#8221; Church parishes often organized bazaars to raise money for charity. When the boy reaches the object of his quest, however, Araby (the church) is empty — except for a woman and two men who speak with English accents. The woman speaks to the story&#8217;s main character in a manner that is &#8220;not encouraging&#8221; and is clearly doing so &#8220;out of a sense of duty.&#8221; Thus, a mission on behalf of an idealized homeland (the boy does not actually know Mangan&#8217;s sister — she is more or less a fantasy to him) is thwarted in turn by the Irish themselves (the charming uncle and his propensity to drink), the church, and England.<br></p>

<p>River is written by Attipate Krishnaswami Ramanujan who is known as one of the greatest modern poet of India. The tone of the poem is based on sarcasm and irony. The structure of the poem has been in paragraphs and single lines. There are four longer verse paragraphs and a shorter one in the beginning. There are only two single isolated lines. This kind of structural arrangement contributes to the effect of irony. It also helps to grasp the main points clearly.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“A River” is a realistic description of the river Vaikai which flows through the city of Madurai. The poem implicitly comments wryly on the lack of realism with which other poets have treated the same topic. The poet has compared and contrasted the attitudes of the old poets and those of the new poets to human suffering. He has come to the conclusion that both the groups of the poets are not sympathetic, rather indifferent to human sorrow and suffering. This kind of attitude makes their poetry weak and unappealing, dry and cheerless. In the first stanza, Madurai is described as a “city of temples and poets,” making it sound like a place of great spiritual significance and associating it also with creativity and beauty. Its poets, indeed, have often sung of “cities and temples”, thereby celebrating places of great importance. Yet no sooner does the speaker make Madurai sound like a mythic, magnificent location than he immediately complicates this impression. He reports that each summer the city’s river—a river that might itself symbolize power, vitality, and energy—“dries to a trickle” uncovering “sand ribs”. He details the underbelly of the river that stays hidden. Visible now, are the bits of “straw and women’s hair” that chokes the rusty gates of the dam and the bridges that are plastered over with ‘patches of repair’. This stanza closes with a complain that all the poets ‘‘only sang of the floods’’. In stanza two, the poet speaks of the river in flood in the rains. He was there once and saw what happened. The river in spate destroys everything in its wake from live-stock to houses to human life. This happens once a year and has been continuing for years in the same pattern. He notes the casual approach of the of the towns people. Anxiously they talk of the rising level of water and enumerate mechanically the ‘precise’ number of steps as the water brims over the bathing places. The flood water “carried off three village houses,/ one pregnant woman/ and a couple of cows/ named Gopi and Brinda.” Humor is presented in the names of the cows and this too, is an attack on the orthodoxy of Hinduism. While cows are given names, no one knows who the pregnant woman is nor are they concerned. The third stanza opens with a complain that new poets have no wit but to blindly copy their predecessors and “no one spoke/ in verse/ of the pregnant woman”. The poet imagines that she may have drowned with not one life in her but two—“twins in her” which kicked “at blank walls even before birth”. He is sarcastic about both the new poets and old poets who seize only the floods to write about and that too merely once a year but did not refer to all these miseries of the woman in their poetic creations. The final stanza the poet mentions that “the river has water enough/ to be poetic” but only “once a year”. Maybe the river is beautiful and charming but it takes a heavy toll on human lives. It only takes “half-hour” to destroy “three village houses”, and take away the lives of humans and animals. This is an unusual poem with many layers of meaning and is a commentary on the indifference of the old and modern poets to the ravages caused by the river in flood and the pain and suffering caused to humans.<br></p>

<p> <br><strong>T</strong>wentieth century poet, critic, scholar and feminist, Adrienne Rich wrote ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’ as a part of her first book of poetry ‘A Change of World’ (1951). Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers is a fine example of feminist poetry, which holds a banner of protest against the patriarchal society. The poem portrays a central character, Aunt Jennifer, as a meek, passive woman, suffocated by her marriage and trapped within the cultural constraints and responsibilities of married life. Aunt Jennifer represented women all over the world, who were caught under the oppressive hand of a patriarchal society. In the first stanza, we are introduced to the protagonist of the poem, Aunt Jennifer whose leisure pursuit is needlework. Instead of describing her, however, Rich chooses to establish Aunt Jennifer’s ownership of Tigers and continues to describe them. But these tiger are not real. They are aunt Jennifer’s knitted tigers on her tapestry.The tapestry on which she has knitted tigers is very symbolic of what she wants to be in life – fearless, assertive, noble and powerful like the tiger. They “prance across a screen”. This implies that the tigers move in a lively fashion, perhaps arrogantly. The tigers are colorfully described as “bright” and seeming full of energy. “Bright” here signifies their powerful and radiant persona. They are “topaz denizens of a world of green”. The ancient Greeks believed that topaz had the ability to increase the strength of those who wore it, and Egyptians thought that it could protect people from physical harm (“Topaz”). The speaker may be using the word topaz for its golden color, or topaz may be a representation of the strength and impenetrability of the tigers. Her tigers are assured and confident inhabitants, inhabitants of “a worldof green”. The tigers certainly seem to be aware of their own power since they have no fear of “the men beneath the tree”.May be the tigers are aunt Jennifer herself and “the men beneath the tree is tree” is her husband and the whole first stanza is symbolizing that aunt Jennifer is not afraid of her husband. But in the second stanza, the reality of Aunt Jennifer is revealed as she is feeble, weak and enslaved, very much the opposite of the tigers she was knitting. Aunt Jennifer and her tigers are in fact polar opposites, her tigers are everything that she isn’t and wishes to be.Her fingers are “fluttering through her wool” showing both physical and mental weakness. She finds “even the ivory needle hard to pull”. The poet portrays the marriage of Jennifer as an unhappy one for her. Aunt Jennifer feels the burden of duty and obedience. Though weeding band’s is not that heavy but “Uncle’s wedding band” is described to have “massive weight” as it is a symbol of bondage, of being crushed in an unhappy marriage. It has kept her encircled and trapped in a burdensome marriage in a patriarchal society- a relationship of subjugation and domination. It has restricted her freedom and eroded her individuality. It “sits heavily upon her hand” because her marriage has taken a toll on her, and she can feel it heavily on her heart and soul. Her husband is strong and fearless, but he is not “chivalric” as her tigers. Chivalric men, unlike her husband, respect their women and act kindly to them. The last stanza starts on a creepy note about Aunt Jennifer’s death. Aunt Jennifer’s oppression is so extreme that not even death will grant her freedom. When Aunt Jen dies, she will die as a lonely and depressed woman, and her hands are “terrified” because they never got to be free again. Even her death couldn’t free her from the “ordeals she was mastered by”. The final two lines of the stanza-and the poem-reflect back on the very opening line. The tigers are still in the panel that she made and they continue to prance, “proud and unafraid”. The tigers that she fought so hard to create despite the overwhelming burden of her life will, indeed, continue to prance forever. By the end of the poem, Aunt Jennifer has fulfilled her need and achieved her own little sense of immortality. Her life was not in vain, she created something out of nothing, something that will live on well after she is dead and buried. This short poem of three four-line stanzas through the world of Aunty Jennifer, tells us about her inner desire to free herself from the clutches of abusive marriage and patriarchal society. She creates an alternative world of free and fearless tigers to express her longing for freedom, a medium of escape from her grim marriage. </p>
